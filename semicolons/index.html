									Semicolon 2015 was a 24-hours global hackathon by Persistent Systems. 
									We as "Team Optimus Goa" developed a platform for social cause 
									collaboration using nodejs and Bootstrap. 
									It included a project-centric model where people could join an event 
									and contribute to the social cause.

									Collaborating a Social event and tools/approval/procurement is difficult. 
									There are many NGOâ€™s and Government schemes who do not have a tool 
									to achieve their Social initiatives. 
									There is no way people can collaborate to create a Social Drive. 
									Existing applications are restricted to only friends.
								</p>
								<p>
									We aim to build a platform that will revolutionize the way 
									Social Initiatives are created and driven by being open to everyone. 
									Social Drive like Beach Cleaning, Blood Donation. 
									People can collaborate and create/participate in events. 
									Users can find events being held currently in areas near them. 
									Provision to donate for initiatives for people 
									who cannot participate but want to donate.
