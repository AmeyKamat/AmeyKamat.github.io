A shear mention of word “interview” can unnerve a job seeker in his college days. Everyone of us has gone through this phase at some point in our lives. Preparing for an interview without proper research is in itself can be a bit confusing and on the day of the acid-test, it can get you in hot water. Companies need an exact candidate who suits their values, work culture and requirements, and not preparing for it can lead to irreversible goof-ups.

<a href="http://www.csestack.org/barclays-interview-questions-recruitment-procedure/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Recently I wrote an article regarding the experiences of Barclays interview</a> on CSEStacks. <a href="http://www.csestack.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CSEStacks</a> collects experiences of the candidates appearing for various organisations including Persistent, IBM, Amazon, Intelligence Bureau etc. I have described the procedure that I went through during placement drive in detail in that article. Hence instead of repeating it here, I would focus more on how I think you should present yourself during interview.
</p><br>

<p>
I compiled list of 6 rules from my experence and my friends' interview stories as to how to present yourself at the interview.
</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Rule 1: Know Your Recruiter</h3>
<p>
Know the vision of the company you are applying. It helps you explain why you are the candidate they are searching (They did ask me this.). Have a look at the history of the company. In my case it was Barclays, who were pioneers in almost every banking technology that we use today. With such a long history of 300+ years, it is not otherworldly if they expect you to know about the company that you are applying for.
</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Rule 2: Write Down Your Aim</h3>
<p>
What do you see yourself doing at the end of the placement process? What are your aims? Where do you see yourself after 4 years? (Believe me I was asked this question.) Be clear about this. Write this down in advance so that you don't fumble during interview. Corporate leadership loves candidates with clear thoughts.
</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Rule 3: Revise Your Resume</h3>
<p>
I can't get tired emphasizing on this. Have a professional resume. Trim it and format it. Proofread it. There is nothing worse than interviewer pointing at errors in the resume during interview. See if you have provided contact details. Have you updated your GPA? Put your resume through meticulous scan and update it when necessary.
</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Rule 4: Don't Answer, Have a Good Conversation</h3>
<p>
One of the motives behind having an interview is to know how you are as a person. Given short period of interviews, it is something that you can only prove through good communication. Gone are the days when interview was analogous to oral examination. Interview in the form of conversation not only gives you enough room to relax but also leaves a lasting impression on the interviewer.
</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Rule 5: Don't Miss Opportunity To Learn</h3>
<p>
Interviewer will give you an opportunity to ask question. Make best of it! This is the time to learn about the company you would be soon joining. Also, during interview, interviewer might explain you a concept. Make sure you understand it very well. Ask doubts until you are satisfied, because next question might be related to it.
</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Rule 6: Do Not Lie</h3>
<p>
You are not expected to know everything. Nor you are expected to have superhuman past record. Be who you are and speak the truth. Do not brag about the skills that you do not possess. Do not produce stories in the air. I was asked about my role model, and I frankly and truthfully told them I did not have any. Interviewers have trained ears and they spot the lies in an instant. It is definitely not worth.
</p><br>

<p>
At the end of the day, I am not an expert and this is definitely not an exclusive list of all To-Dos during interview. But these are the points that I have learnt either from my own experience the hard way or through others' experience.
</p><br>

<p>
All the best!!
