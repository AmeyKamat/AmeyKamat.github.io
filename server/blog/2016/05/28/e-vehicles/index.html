Recently, I attended <i>"The launch of E-vehicles in Goa by DOT and Infra Red"</i> in Goa, thanks to one of my closest friends, who invited me to her fathers new partnership. In this post, I will talk about my understanding and experiences with the e-vehicles at the event.<!--excerpt--> The concept models of E-rikshaw and E-scooters were demonstrated at the event. I had a great opportunity to ride e-scooter (I would have loved if the first rikshaw I drove in my life could be e-rikshaw though :P).
</p>

<div class="row" style="padding:20px">

</div>

<p>
E-vehicles as you would have correctly guessed, run on stored electricity. They have zero carbon emission, except for the fact that the very generation of electricity leads to carbon emmision at power generation facility. This also means that the road catering to e-vehicles can very well be healthy for travellers.
</p><br>

<p>
Before beginning with my experience with e-scooter, let's dive into the history of e-vehicles a bit. In 1827 a slovak priest appears to have designed the world's first electric motor which he used to power a small car an year after. It baffles me as to why it should take two centuries since this invension for my locality to see the launch of first viable electric vehicles. Roots of this are hidden in the history as well. Discovery of gasoline fields in Texas led to oil capitalists fiercely competing with the e-vehicle industry. Also e-vehicles could not comply to large distance transit requirements. This lead to slow demise of e-vehicles, until the oil deposits became scarce. And now the industry has leapt from ashes like a phoenix again.
</p><br>

<p>
So are these vehicles viable on indian roads? We already have seen suburban trains  running on electricity. Our metros and monorails run on electricity too. Rail ministry has plans to introduce maglevs and Kolkata has trams running on electricity. Delhi has already allowed e-rikshaw for that  matter. So e-vehicles are definitely viable. And now e-vehicles are trying to capture private transit market.
</p><br>

<p>
That brings me to my own experience about e-scooter. The ride on the e-scooter was very smooth. The vehicles (even the e-rickshaws) are practically noiseless which will definitely help bring down noise levels on Indian roads. The max speed of 40km/h is pretty enough for city traffic. The prices of these scooters are on higher side, but still comparable to other petrol models. The plan to bring electric buses into the frey was announced during the launch. I would definitely love to see a day wen Indian roads would be noise and emmisionless (aka odd-even rule-less).
</p><br>

<p>
On the other hand, I am not sure if e-scooter or even e-rikshaw for that matter is capable to conquer hilly tracks without hickups. I am not an expert in automobiles and I could be totally wrong over here, what I felt is based on my experience of the model that I rode on. Also, the vehicle makes no sound at all. Which can totally mean that drivers of other vehicles won't notice the e-vehicle behind him unless he notices it in the mirror. This could lead to severe mis-judgement on the roads.
</p><br>

<p>
For the benefit of the reader, let me summerize my observations,
</p><br>

<p>
<b>Pros:</b><br>
1. E-vehicles are carbon emmisions free on the roads<br>
2. They are noise free.<br>
3. It would be fun to ride e-scooter on roads :P<br><br>

<b>Cons:</b><br>
1. Apperently incapable of climbing hilly tracks (???)<br>
2. Could be source of mis-judgement on the roads<br>
3. The traffic rules still are relevent :P (But they are for our safety, aren't they?)
</p><br>

<p>
E-vehicles are essential for our future. If we don't adapt to those now, we might not get a third chance. It is time to embrace this more sustainable technology for a better green future.
