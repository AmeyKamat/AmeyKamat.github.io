title: Turing Test for Sound Breached!
---

<p>
Sound is one of the primary senses that human body can detect. From thunderstorm to soft rustling of leaves, we listen to variety of sounds of different pitches and loudness in our life time, and our hearing system is tuned enough to distinguish one sound from other. Fooling such a perfect system is one heck of a thing! And that is exactly what Researchers at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab have been successful in doing!

This week <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.08512v2.pdf" target="_blank">MIT CSAIL published about the deep learning algorithm that successfully passed Turing Test for Sound</a>. In this post I would talk about the approach followed.

A deep learning network, which is a neural network with large number of hidden layers and complicated synapse connections, is first trained to generate sound features. Researchers collected 1000 samples of videos in which drumstick beats certain material. For each video in the training set, the sound was separated from the video and the muted video was fed to the network. During training, efforts are done to reduce error in the sound features such as frequency and amplitude generated by the network and the actual sound features.

<p>
Once the network is trained enough, muted test video is fed to the system, corresponding sound features are generated, and finally a match is done in the database for a sound which resembles these features closely. The sounds collected from the database are stitched together to serve a coherent sound file.
</p><br>

<p>
The testing was done online with human judges being shown the one video with real sound and other video with generated sound. Judge had to select one video that he finds real. Results show that every 2 out of 3 judges were fooled by the algorithm, which is quite impressive. It can be judged how well the algorithm performs in identifying the correct surface.
</p><br>

<p>
But is this algorithm fullproof? No. It is seen that the impact between drumstrick and surface is sometimes falsely detected causing a false hit. Also sounds like sound of breeze or scratching where there is no apperant impact, cannot be detected. The algorithm in these case is far from being perfect.

<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11893868" target="_blank">One of the forums raised another argument against this result</a>. With the advent of animated films, it is likely that human ears are accustomed to artificial sounds enough to be fooled by the sound generated by the algorithm. This argument not only questions the algorithm but the entire testing procedure.
</p><br>

<p>
At this point in time it makes sense to take these results with a grain of salt. Generating a sound perfect enough to fool humans is in itself an achivement. From automated sound generation for animated sequence to detecting surface quality based on a video the applications are countless. It is just the matter of time for us to see where this research takes us.
