I had this awesome opportunity to attend IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology 2016 at Taipei, Taiwan, to present a paper co-authored on 3-Axis CNC automation. These seven days of my first international voyage were full of new experiences. In this post, I will try to list my best moments at Taiwan.

<h3 class="text-center">Industry Forum</h3>
<p>
Industry 4.0 in nutshell is about integrating different manufacturing practices dynamically using emerging technology like IoT and Cloud computing. In the inaugural session attendees had a good peep in about how the technology is evolving manufacturing. The panelists suggested the manufacturing is moving towards incorporating creativity, and that is when Industry 5.0 would be born. With the requirement from industry for manufacturing with batch size of 1, the complexity of the adaptable manufacturing unit increases exponentially. That is where technology plays part in modelling, simulation, training, unit integration, testing and service.
<br><br>
<b>Why was it special?</b>
<br>
Got to interact with resourceful people.
</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Conversation with Joe Gemma</h3>
<p>
I had an opportunity to have conversation with Joe Gemma, CEO of Kuka Robotics and President, International Federation of Robotics. We discussed about how concept of “Manufacturing for people” i.e. bringing manufacturing to individuals. He spoke about how the industry is possibly moving towards this concept in the fields of CNC manufacturing and 3D printing. He suggested that this concept may be relevant in the near future.
<br>
<b>Why was it special?</b>
<br><br>
Because it was cool! as a bonus, this person was very clear about the future of the industry to the ground.
</p>

<h3 class="text-center">My First Presentation on International Platform</h3>
<p>
My presentation on how to automate manufacturing for 3-Axis CNC for 3D models was scheduled on the second day. In moments full of anxiety and excitement, the presentation was well received by the audience with the chair for the session opining with hope that this should be reality soon.
<br><br>
<b>Why was it special?</b>
<br>
The first experience!
</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Friendly Chat over Taiwanese and Indian Culture</h3>
<p>
These were one of the great moments on the trip. I had great Taiwanese volunteers around which I had opportunity to interact with. We had whole night discussion over Taiwanese cuisine, sports, politics, literature, climate and what not! I am really grateful to Kuo, Lee and Hsieh for these wonderful moments.
<br><br>
<b>Why was it special?</b>
<br>
Midnight talks sharing all about each others countries and cultures. What can be better?
</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Friendly Chat over Taiwanese and Indian Culture</h3>
<p>
This was the most wonderful part of my entire journey. We were provided a tour of iCeira Lab in National Taiwan University, Taipei. iCeira is a lab in National Taiwan University whic is dedicated to robotics. Various projects demonstrated involved 7-Axis CNC Router, Hybrid Additive and Subtractive Manufacturing machine, Einstein Head showing different emotions, Humanoid, and Painter Robot. Unfortunately, photography was not allowed inside iCeira building.
<br><br>
<b>Why was it special?</b>
<br>
iCeira visit was completely contrast to what gloomy image that turns up in mind when some one talks about research in India.
</p>

<h3 class="text-center">The Final Verdict</h3>
<p>
Actually I lied. The memories in Taiwan cannot be limited by such a list. The discipline of Taiwanese on the roads, their hospitality, simplicity and contrast of what our part of world thinks about them to what they actually are were earth shattering for me. I had opportunity to sneak through Taiwanese market, enjoy ride on the fastest elevator on the planet at Taipei 101 and offcourse, witnessing parade at Presidents Office and following the unique taiwanese way of praying at Longshan Temple are all equivalently memorable. That single week was hell packed with so many exiting moments!
